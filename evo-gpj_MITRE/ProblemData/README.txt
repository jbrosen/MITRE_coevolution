See http://tracer.uc3m.es/tws/TimeSeriesWeb/repo.html for an
explanation of some of these benchmarks. Not all may be suitable for
GP. Sun-spots and Mackey-Glass certainly are.

BTW the url they give there for Mackey-Glass time series is wrong
(omits "data") -- this is the right one:

http://tracer.uc3m.es/tws/TimeSeriesWeb/data/mackey.txt

Silva/Vanneschi's bioavailability.txt seems to be a good hard
benchmark. But need to review their papers to interpret the rows and
columns.
